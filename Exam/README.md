## Bee segmentation using hand crafted feature extraction algorithm and Classification using Convolutional Neural Network 

#### Code
Just by opening main.ipynb on Github it will execute the python scripts and after a while it will show all results.
The results cropped images is written to results folder, after that I ran "Bee Classifier/check_bee.py" that will read the images from results folder and will give a score for each one of them how near the image to be a bee image. After that the script will print out the best match image with the best score.
